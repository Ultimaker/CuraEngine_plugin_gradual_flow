# CuraEngine_plugin_gradual_flow

The gradual flow functionality in Cura was initially developped as an engine plugin, mostly as a proof of concept for the plugins mechanism.

It has now been merged into [CuraEngine](https://github.com/Ultimaker/CuraEngine) itself to ease the evolution and integration of this functionality.
